# Monster-FIghters
My first ever unity game.

Monster Fighters is a 2d game where the main perpose of the game is to servive each level. The player controls a character which can be moved using the arrow keys (left and right arrow keys to move left and right, and up arrow key to jump). The player can also use the space bar to attack, when the player attacks the character throws an axe in the direction the player's character is looking. Each level spawns a certain number of monsters and if the player touches the monsters then the level ends and the player looses the level.
 
The player can win a level in two ways, one is to avoid touching any monsters until all the monsters have spawned, or two by killing all the monsters using the attack. If a monster is killed by an attack there is a chance that it might drop a coin which player can collect by walking into it. The coins collected by the player can be used to unlock new playable characters.
